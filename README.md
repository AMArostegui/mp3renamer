# Mp3 renamer and organizer

**WinForms C#** application created to manage my local Mp3 file collection. This is a Windows only app developed with **.NET Framework 3.5**

It runs trough a folder, detect Mp3 files, and make ID3 tags and file names consistent to my own naming convention.

This is a fork of a project created by my friend Víctor Ruiz
